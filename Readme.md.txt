# Animal Inheritance in Java

This project demonstrates Java inheritance and method overriding using a simple mammal class hierarchy.

## Features
- A base class `Mammal` with a method `getInterestingFacts()`
- Subclasses (`BobCatExample`, `Cheetah`, `GiantPanda`) override the method to return custom facts
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, and polymorphism

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:


## Output
Displays interesting facts about bobcats, cheetahs, and pandas using overridden methods.
